# NativePlex
This is an attempt at creating a native Plex player for macOS/iPadOS/iOS. 
Why did I create this ?
- Free / Opensource alternative to the iOS client
- Performance
- Native / Apple look and feel
- Learning purpose
- Inspired by this [great plex design reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/nvcr6s/i_started_working_on_a_nativefeel_plex_client_ui/) 

The project was never finished but it can already do basics things. I probably won't be working on it unless many people show interest. However I will gladly accept any valid PRs.

## Screenshots
Design heavily inspired by this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/nvcr6s/i_started_working_on_a_nativefeel_plex_client_ui/) .
